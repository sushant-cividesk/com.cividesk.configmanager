# Permissions

Configuration Manager defines granular permissions so sites can separate read, export, import, and administration responsibilities.

Release history is maintained in `../CHANGELOG.md`.

## Permission list

### access CiviCRM configuration manager

Allows a user to open the Configuration Manager UI and view status, pending changes, validation results, and diff details.

Recommended for:

- Technical administrators
- Developers
- Release managers

### export CiviCRM configuration

Allows a user to export active CiviCRM configuration to YAML, download the sync directory as a ZIP archive, and download single YAML files.

This permission can overwrite files in the sync directory.

Recommended for:

- Developers
- Release managers

### import CiviCRM configuration

Allows a user to stage YAML or ZIP files and apply supported create/update imports into CiviCRM.

This permission changes active CiviCRM configuration.

Recommended for:

- Release managers
- Senior technical administrators

### administer CiviCRM configuration manager

Allows a user to change Configuration Manager settings such as managed types and the settings allowlist.

This also allows editing the Sync Directory when the directory is not code-owned.

Recommended for:

- Technical administrators responsible for deployment policy

## Superuser behavior

Users with `administer CiviCRM` are treated as superusers for this extension and can perform all Configuration Manager actions.

## Route and API behavior

- The admin route requires `access CiviCRM configuration manager`.
- UI actions perform additional permission checks before export, import, upload, download, and settings operations.
- API4 actions use matching permissions.

## Code-owned Sync Directory

When `civicfg_sync_dir` is set in `civicrm.settings.php`, users cannot change the Sync Directory from the UI, even if they have Configuration Manager administration permission.

Other settings remain editable according to normal permissions.

## Production recommendation

For production environments:

- Grant access/status visibility to technical administrators.
- Grant export permission only to trusted developers or release managers.
- Grant import permission only to release managers or senior administrators.
- Grant administer permission only to the person/team controlling deployment policy.
